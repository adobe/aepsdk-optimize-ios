# Adobe Experience Platform Optimize Mobile SDK

## About this project

The AEPOptimize mobile SDK extension provides APIs to enable real-time personalization workflows in the Adobe Experience Platform SDKs using Adobe Target or Adobe Journey Optimizer Offer Decisioning. It depends on AEPCore and requires AEPEdge Extension to send personalization query events to the Experience Edge network.

## Requirements

- Xcode 11.0 (or newer)
- Swift 5.1 (or newer)

## Installation

These are currently the supported installation options:

### [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html)

```ruby
# Podfile
use_frameworks!

# for app development, include all the following pods
target 'YOUR_TARGET_NAME' do
      pod 'AEPCore'
      pod 'AEPEdge'
      pod 'AEPOptimize'
end
```

Replace `YOUR_TARGET_NAME` and then, in the `Podfile` directory, type:

```ruby
$ pod install
```

### [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

To add the AEPOptimize Package to your application, from the Xcode menu select:

`File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...`

Enter the URL for the AEPOptimize package repository: `https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-optimize-ios.git`. Click Next.

Specify the Version rule for the package options. Click Next and Finish.

Alternatively, if your project has a `Package.swift` file, you can add AEPOptimize directly to your dependencies:

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-optimize-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
],
targets: [
       .target(name: "YourTarget",
               dependencies: ["AEPOptimize"],
               path: "your/path"),
    ]
]
```

### Binaries

To generate `AEPOptimize.xcframework`, run the following Makefile target from the project root directory:

```ruby
$ make archive
```

This generates the xcframework under the `build` folder. Drag and drop the `.xcframework` to your app target in Xcode.

## Development

To install pod dependencies after you clone or download this project, run the following Makefile target from the root directory:

~~~
make pod-install
~~~

To fetch latest versions of the dependencies, run the following Makefile target from the project root directory:

~~~
make pod-update
~~~

#### Open the project Xcode workspace

To open the project workspace in Xcode, click on `AEPOptimize.xcworkspace` or run the following Makefile target from the project root directory:

~~~
make open
~~~

#### Run tests

To execute the tests, run the following Makefile target from the project root directory:
